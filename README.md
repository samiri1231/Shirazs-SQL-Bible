# Shirazs-SQL-Bible
This was a massive SQL script I made when learning that contains every major function in MySQL with commentary from yours truly.
**Disclaimer: I do not intend to poke fun at any form of religion in any way, I simply used it because it is my SQL scripture and the word sounded funny**

If you come accross this 'Bible' and decide and it helped you learn SQL just a little bit more I would appreciate it if you left a comment!

If you just found it funny too I would love to hear which part you found funny.

It has been a while since I sfw checked this file as its almost 500 lines, so be careful it may be a bit adult/have some ill humored jokes.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!!
