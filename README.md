# Shirazs-SQL-Bible
This was a massive SQL script I made when learning that contains every major function in MySQL with commentary from yours truly.
**Disclaimer: I do not intend to poke fun at any form of religion in any way, I simply used it because it is my SQL scripture and the word sounded funny**

If you come accross this 'Bible' and decide and it helped you learn SQL just a little bit more I would appreciate it if you left a comment!
If you just found it funny too I would love to hear which part you found funny.
**Second disclaimer: I used a specific database for the examples and queries it is also linked to this**

## Files
- Shiraz's SQL Bible.sql => its the SQL holy book (for me atleast)
- README.md => the thing you are currently reading
- Beginner-Parks_and_Rec_Create_db.sql => this is the database I used

It has been a while since I sfw checked this file as its almost 500 lines, so be careful it may be a bit adult/have some ill humored jokes.


*Credit goes to Alex The Analyst on youtube for providing the database and the information*
Thank you for taking the time to read this!!
